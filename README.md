# Final-Project-

PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project aims to have predictive and descriptive measures in LA crime. Datasets including crime logs of the city from 2020 to current will be utilzied to create these measures. Visualizations and other metircs will attempt to highlight aspects about LA crime, in an attempt to aid in resource utilization.

SETUP INSTRUCTION
To setup the file, create a virtual environment: View -> Command Pallete. Then, type in "Create Environment", and choose your environment from there.

Be sure to install the required packages from requirements.txt

Once done, go to main.py, and run that file. It will take some time for the process to complete. 



Due to the size of the data, there will be no csv initially to work with. Rather, extract.py will fetch the entire csv from the origin source, and the subsequent .py files will load them into data/ under the name "cleaned_data.csv"


At one point when running main.py, a visualization will pop up. The pipeline will not continue until that visualization is closed out of. Please make sure to do so in order to see the rest of the process, and the rest of the visualizations pop up
